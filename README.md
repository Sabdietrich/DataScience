This work is proposed to describe a new dataset that contains many QoE Influence Factors (QoE IFs) and subjective Mean Opinion Scores(MOS). This dataset is collected during the PoQeMoN project (www.ip-label.fr/performance-wire/ projet-collaboratif-platform-quality-evaluation-mobile-networks) where a crowd measurement platform is implemented to assess YouTube end userâ€™s QoE in mobile environments (UMTS, HSPA, LTE, etc.). This dataset concerns collecting a lot of QoE IFs using a VLC media player. The used platform consists on an Android-based applica- tion developed and installed on the end user device (phones and tablets).
